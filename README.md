Started out by deleting unnecessary files after running the $npm create-react-app command, found relevant favicon file and added that to the index.html in the public folder of the project. Then to design the Navbar component. As per guidelines I have not used any css frameworks to design any of the layouts which you see on the screen.

## Navbar Component

<img src="" alt="navbar"/>

Before designing or buidling any layouts or components, I made a note of the colors(color pallete) that are originally used in the actual website (starbucks.com)

 #00704A - starbucks green
 #27251F - black
 #d4e9e2 - lighter blue
 #006241 - dark green

Next moved on to designing the disclaimer banner and the footer component of the react web app.
